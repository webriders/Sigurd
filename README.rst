==============
Sigurd project
==============

Sigurd project is **Django project configurator**.

Django is very flexible framework. You could build web-application of any size and complexity with it.
But if your project becomes big, sometimes (*often, actually*) its structure becomes a mess!
And its configuration becomes very complex.

Our goal is to make configuration simple and clear for big and complex Django projects. We even offer a project profiles!

Sigurd contains of two parts:
  1. **Project utilities** (tools to configure your project)
  2. **Web-configurator** (DB of existent configurations)

-----------------
Project Utilities
-----------------

Utilities extends your Django project configuration:
  1. You can add/remove applications into your Django project from the command line
  2. You can it as well from the config file
  3. After apps were installed you can to manually re-configure them
  4. You can create different Django project profiles

There are:
  1. Command-line project utils
  2. Python (Django) configuration utils
